# ADGMaker

Create awesome Free (as in Freedom!) Ableton Live Instuments from [Philharmonic Orchestra](http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/make_music/) samples.

## Usage

Download an instrument from [the Philharmonic Orchestra website](http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/make_music/double_bass) and unzip it.

Then, (from a virtualenv), run:

    python adgmaker.py double_bass/

Then copy all of the .adg files to:

     ~/Music/Ableton/User\ Library/Presets/Instruments/Drum\ Rack/ 

(or wherever your Ableton is installed).

Then copy all of the mp3s to:

    ~/Music/Ableton/User\ Library/Samples/Imported

Then go to File -> Manage Files -> Manage User Library and use your new instruments!

Enjoy!
